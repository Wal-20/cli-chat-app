Server listens to user signups/ logins, chatroom messages/creation, only the admin can add users,
users can req to join a room, chatrooms should terminate when all members but one leave.
if an admin is the only one left in a room, it doesn't terminate, but the room will terminate if they leave to join another room.
if last member is not admin, they will be kicked out of the room and given a noti that room was terminated.
if admin leaves, admin role transfers to next member by join order.

admin invites members through id or username

user is given a log of all prev active chatrooms should they want to join back.

(e.g., index chatroom IDs for fast lookup).

text colors, ascii sticker like messages, file uploads


Monitoring & Logging:

Implement logging to monitor who joins/leaves chatrooms, when chatrooms are created/terminated, and other critical actions. This will help debug issues and detect any suspicious behavior.
Rate Limiting for Message Sending:

Rate Limiting for message sending:

To prevent spamming or flooding in chatrooms, consider adding rate limits on the number of messages a user can send in a given period.


Add "Kick" functionality for Admins: Allow admins to kick users from chatrooms instead of just adding/inviting users. This will give admins more control over chatroom management.
kicked users can req to join back or be added by admin, banned users cannot, and chatroom will not be displayed to them on search until they are unbanned.


Custom Error Messages: Provide informative feedback to users when they perform invalid actions (e.g., trying to join a non-existent room or sending messages without being in a room).


TODOS:
- IMPORTANT: remove stale user-chatroom associations from db, should be done when user is not banned, but hasn't joined in 30 days
- remove old notifications
- admin actions: add any you find 
- notifications for user
- send a notification if admin has kicked the user
- for the future, look into errors raised from the db and raise the proper messages
- give the ability for owner to make admins
- handle owner / last admin leaving chatroom (no admins left in a chatroom) 
- Expose the app to curl requests instead of just relying on users installing binaries
- (Chore) make the json tags in the backend models snake case, make sure they're the same as the ones in the client
- write a deployment workflow that recompiles the binaries and redeploys and whatever else is neccessary when merging a branch or pushing to master
- Add a page to display message that server is down, instead of showing nothing at all

UI PAGES TODO:
- invite / kick / ban interfaces
- Join chatroom view, for private chatrooms, the id should be provided in the invite noti, user enters id and joins only if they are invited and are not banned
- handle client errors more gracefully

IMMEDIATE TODOS:
- fix registration 400 issue (done but needs some testing)
